sustainability_title: "Sustainable Corrugated Boxes"
sustainability_content: "**__Corrugated boxes__** are one of the most sustainable and widely recycled packaging solutions available today. \n\nMade primarily from renewable resources like paper and cardboard, corrugated boxes are designed to be easily recyclable and biodegradable. With a high recovery rate through curbside recycling programs, these boxes help minimize environmental impact and reduce landfill waste."
sustainability_subcontent_title: "Efficient, Recyclable Packaging"
sustainability_subcontent: "Choosing corrugated packaging supports a circular economy by promoting fiber reuse and reducing the need for new raw materials, making it a sustainable choice for both businesses and consumers."

sustainability_content_2: "PET and HDPE containers are mechanically recycled into recycled content or PCR pellets, promoting sustainable manufacturing"

sustainability_title_3: "PET Packaging"
sustainability_quote_3:
  "“PET is efficent, light, recycable, with unmatched scope
  for recycled content. A sustainable package must first
  serve its essential function: to protect its content,
  delivering it safely with all its taste, thereby form and
  other features intact, thereby eliminating waste through
  product damage and spoilage. PET does all and more. -
  NAPCOR”"
sustainability_content_3: "__**PET**__ is the most recycled plastic worldwide, with **1.5 billion pounds** of PET bottles and containers recovered each year in the U.S. This high recycling rate highlights PET’s role in **sustainable packaging** and **environmental conservation**."
