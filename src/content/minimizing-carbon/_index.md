vision_content: "Our organization strives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and optimize resource use throughout all its operations—across dairies, manufacturing plants, and supply chain partners."
vision_content2: "This includes investing in renewable energy (solar and bio-gas), improving energy efficiency, and encouraging responsible feed sourcing that shrinks the overall carbon footprint.\n\nBy continually measuring, bench marking, and innovating around energy and emissions, we’ve built long-term resilience while staying true to our commitment to producing wholesome dairy products sustainably."

    bulletpoints:
      - "One of our dairies operates a private digester capturing 95% of flush manure methane—total methane captured avoids 36,105 mt CO₂e annually—and produces biogas that avoids 9,794 mt CO₂e when used for on-site power, generating LCFS & RIN credits."
      - "Two dairies have each achieved 100% manure capture, with biogas used for on-site power or pipeline injection."
