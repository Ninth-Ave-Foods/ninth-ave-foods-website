vision_title: "Sustainable practices to cut emissions across our operations"
vision_content: "Our organization strives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and optimize resource use throughout all its operations—across dairies, manufacturing plants, and supply chain partners."
vision_content2: "This includes investing in renewable energy (solar and bio-gas), improving energy efficiency, and encouraging responsible feed sourcing that shrinks our overall carbon footprint.\n\nBy continually measuring, bench marking, and innovating around energy and emissions, we’ve built long-term resilience while staying true to our commitment to producing wholesome dairy products sustainably."

    bulletpoints:
      - "One of our dairies operates a private digester capturing __**95%**__ \nof flush manure methane—total methane captured avoids __**36,105 mt CO₂e**__ annually\n—and produces biogas that avoids __**9,794 mt CO₂e**__ when used for on-site power, generating **Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS)** & **Renewable Identification Number (RIN)** credits."
      - "Two dairies have each achieved __**100% manure capture**__, with biogas used for on-site power or pipeline injection."
