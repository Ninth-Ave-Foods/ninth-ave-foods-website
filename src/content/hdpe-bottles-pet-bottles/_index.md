sustainability_title: "HDPE and PET Sustainability"
sustainability_content: "HDPE and PET containers can be manufactured to be __**100% recyclable**__. 
Most customers have the easy of curbside recycling pickup for PET and HDPE containers.
This ability for curbside recycling help reduce waste to the landfill."

sustainability_title_2: "Energy Efficient - Lower GHG emissions"
sustainability_content_2: "PET and HDPE recycled containers can be processed through mechanical recycling back to plastic resin pellets called recycled content or PCR."

sustainability_title_3: "PET Packaging"
sustainability_quote_3: "“PET is efficent, light, recycable, with unmatched scope
                      for recycled content. A sustainable package must first
                      serve its essential function: to protect its content,
                      delivering it safely with all its taste, thereby form and
                      other features intact, thereby eliminating waste through
                      product damage and spoilage. PET does all and more. -
